# FUBAR Labs Autonomous PowerWheels Racing

Simple model in `basic_model.py`.  Currently linear with mean squared error loss (summed over outputs?)

## Inputs

* Webcam image
* Current Accel
* Current Speed
* Current Distance from rangefinder
* Current Steering wheel angle

## Outputs

* Accel (maybe braking too)
* Steering Wheel angle

# Data sources

* [DeepDrive](http://deepdrive.io)
